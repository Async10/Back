# Back (and Forth)

Back is a Forth-like toy language. This means it is similar to, and heavily ispired by, Forth (despite both a different syntax and functionality).

Back implements enough functionality to be turing complete. Turing completeness is proven by impelementing the rule 110 cellular automaton, which itself is known to be turing complete, in Back.

Back compiles to x86 assembly, which again is compiled to a statically-linked linux executable. Support for other platforms is not planned.
